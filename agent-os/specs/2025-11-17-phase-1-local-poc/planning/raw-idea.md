# Phase 1 - Local PoC (Temi Robot + Local LLM)

## Feature Description

Build a working proof-of-concept conversational robot using:
- Android app with Temi SDK integration
- Local LLM (Gemma 2/3) for handling conversations
- Local speech recognition (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS)
- Hardcoded files inside the project for menu and knowledge base data (no backend/database)
- Visual status indicator (red=thinking, green=speaking, grey=idle)
- Ability to ask questions about the menu and knowledge base

## Goal

Create a fully functional local conversational robot that can answer questions about a restaurant's menu and general information, running entirely on-device without requiring cloud services or backend infrastructure.
